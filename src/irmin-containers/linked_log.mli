(** [Linked_log] is a linked list implementation of the log. In this, two copies
    of the log share their common predecessor. The type of the log entries, the
    method to obtain timestamp, a hashing method and a content addressable store
    maker are provided by the user. *)

(** Signature of [Linked_log] *)
module type S = sig
  module Store : Irmin.S
  (** Store for the log. All store related operations like branching, cloning,
      merging, etc are done through this module. *)

  type value
  (** Type of log entry *)

  type cursor
  (** Type of cursor. Cursor is like a marker from which a certain number of
      entries can be read *)

  val append : path:Store.key -> Store.t -> value -> unit Lwt.t
  (** Append an entry to the log *)

  val get_cursor : path:Store.key -> Store.t -> cursor Lwt.t
  (** Get the cursor *)

  val read : num_items:int -> cursor -> (value list * cursor) Lwt.t
  (** Read a certain number of entries starting from the cursor. If the number
      specified is greater than the number of log entires from the cursor, the
      log is read till the end. If the input cursor has already reached the end,
      then an empty list is returned *)

  val read_all : path:Store.key -> Store.t -> value list Lwt.t
  (** Read the entire log *)
end

(** [Make] returns a mergeable linked log using the backend and other parameters
    as specified by the user. *)
