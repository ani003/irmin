(** Lww_register is the implementation of last-write-wins register. The value to
    be stored in the register and the timestamp method are provided by the user.
    Merge semantics : The value with the largest timestamp is chosen. If two
    values have the same timestamp, then the larger value is selected based on
    the compare specified by the user. *)

  (** Type information about the value to be stored. *)

  val compare : t -> t -> int
  (** Comparator for values of the type specified above. This is used to break
      ties while merging *)

(** Time specifies the method to obtain timestamps for the values to be stored.
    It is necessary for the timestamps to be monotonic for the register to
    function properly. *)

    provided by the user to specify the type of value being stored. The register
